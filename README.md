# IN Vented

## Branch Policy
- Code should only be merged with **master** from **develop** after a pull request for this has been reviewed by two other people in accordance with the coding standards guide.
- Keep with the naming convention of **feature/some-Feature** to keep clear what the purpose of the branch is for.
